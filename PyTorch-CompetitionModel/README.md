# PyTorch Competition Model
# advanced artificial intelligence - 2nd year - university

## Overview
This project contains a trained PyTorch model and inference script developed for a machine learning competition. The goal was to train a high-performing model for a supervised learning task (classification or regression), and submit predictions based on unseen test data.

## Contents
- `competition_201469795.py`: Main script for data loading, preprocessing, model definition, and prediction.
- `201469795.pt`: Trained model checkpoint saved after final training round.

## Features
- Custom model architecture using PyTorch
- Support for loading saved weights (`.pt` file)
- Efficient inference pipeline for test data
- Modular design for easy reuse and experimentation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy / pandas (for data handling)
